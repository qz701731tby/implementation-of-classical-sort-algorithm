# implementation-of-classical-sort-algorithm
In this repository, I realize some classical sort algorithm with Java

You can directly use the sort Algorithm the same way as in the testfile. This support any comparable variable in Java, like Integer or String.
SortAlgorithm.sort(array, sort_type, seq)
SortAlgorithm.sort(array, "quick", "Asc")
